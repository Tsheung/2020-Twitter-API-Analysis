    "I created a class named Streamer to stream the first 1000 tweets without Geotags. I wanted to just examine the number of tweets that mentioned a certain candidate. The first function filters the tweet as English and prints out the current number of tweets recieved. I wanted to collect only 1000 tweets first. The second function allows the program to disconnect if there are errors while streaming. The class appends the tweets into a list called my_tweet.  "
